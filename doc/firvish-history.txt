Opinionated re-implementations of |:oldfiles| and |:jumps|, which are
local to the current workspace.

                                                                  *:Oldfiles[!]*
Like |:oldfiles| but filters |v:oldfiles| to only show you old files in
the current workspace.

By default, :Oldfiles opens a quickfix list with the filtered old files,
while :Oldfiles! opens a plain |firvish-buffer|.

See |firvish-history-config| for configuration options.

                                                                     *:Jumps[!]*
Like |:jumps| but filters |getjumplist()| to only show you jumps that took
place in/between files within the current workspace.

By default, :Jumps opens a quickfix list with the filtered old files,
while :Jumps! opens a plain |firvish-buffer|.

See |firvish-history-config| for configuration options.

Default configuration:

  ---Commands open a quickfix list unless <bang> is given, in which case
  ---they open a plain |firvish-buffer|. This setting, when `true`,
  ---inverts that behavior.

  ---How to open the |firvish-buffer|
  open = function(filename)
    vim.cmd.edit(filename)
  end,
  ---Keymaps to set in the |firvish-buffer|
